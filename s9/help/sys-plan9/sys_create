S9 EXT  (sys:create string integer integer)  ==>  integer

Create a new file or prepare to rewrite an existing file, open it according
to INTEGER (argument 2 - see: sys:open) and return a file descriptor.

If the file is new, the owner is set to the userid of the creating process
group; the group to that of the containing directory, the permissions to
INTEGER (argument 3) ANDed with the permissions of the containing directory.

If the file already exists, it is truncated to 0 length and the permissions,
owner, and group remain unchanged.
