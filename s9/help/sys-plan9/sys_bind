S9 EXT  (sys:bind string string integer)  ==>  boolean

Modify the current process group name space.

The first STRING is the name of an existing file or directory in
the current name space.

The second STRING becomes an alias for the original object.

INTEGER is the flag to apply. INTEGER may have one of these values:

        (sys:magic-const "MREPL)     Replace the old file by the new one.
        (sys:magic-const "MBEFORE")  Both the old and new files must be directories.
                                     Add the constituent files of the new directory
                                     to the union directory at old so its contents
                                     appear first in the union.
        (sys:magic-const "MAFTER")   Like MBEFORE but appended to the union.
        (sys:magic-const "MCREATE")  Can be OR'd with other flags to cause a union
                                     directory to be created if it does not already
                                     exist.

(sys:bind "/rc/bin" "/bin" (sys:magic-const "MAFTER"))  ==>  #t
