S9 EXT  (sys:dup integer integer)  ==>  integer

Given a file descriptor INTEGER (arg 1), referring to an open file,
return a new file descriptor referring to the same file.

If INTEGER (arg 2) is -1, the system chooses the lowest available file
descriptor. Otherwise, INTEGER is used.

INTEGER (arg 2) can be no greater than 20 more than the highest file
descriptor ever used by the program.

(sys:dup 2 -1)  ==>  3
(sys:dup 1 6)  ==>  6
