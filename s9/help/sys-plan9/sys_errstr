S9 EXT  (sys:errstr string)  ==>  string

When a system call fails it returns -1 and records a null
terminated string describing the error in a per-process
buffer.

sys:errstr swaps the contents of that buffer with STRING, though
it usually called with an empty string.

STRING will be truncated to ERRMAX if it is too long.

If no system call has generated an error since the last call to
sys:errstr, an empty string is returned.
