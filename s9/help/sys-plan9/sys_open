S9 EXT  (sys:open string integer)            ==>  integer
        (sys:close integer)                  ==>  integer
        (sys:create string integer integer)  ==>  integer

SYS:OPEN opens file STRING. INTEGER is the mode with which to open the file.
    It may be one of the following:

        sys:OREAD    Open with read permissions.
        sys:OWRITE   Open with write permissions.
        sys:ORDWR    Open with read/write permissions.
        sys:OEXEC    Open with execute permission.

    The following may be bitwise ORed with the aforementioned modes:

        sys:OTRUNC   Truncate the file to zero length before opening it.
        sys:OCEXEC   Close the file when an exec or execl system call is made.
        sys:ORCLOSE  Remove the file when it is closed by everyone who has a
                     copy of the file descriptor.

SYS:CLOSE closes the file represented by the file descriptor INTEGER.

SYS:CREATE creates a new file or prepare to rewrite an existing file, opening it
according to INTEGER (argument 2) and returns a file descriptor.

If the file is new, the owner is set to the userid of the creating process
group; the group to that of the containing directory; the permissions to
INTEGER (argument 3) ANDed with the permissions of the containing directory.

If the file already exists, it is truncated to 0 length and the permissions,
owner, and group remain unchanged.

Argument 2 (INTEGER) may be ORed with the following:
        sys:OEXCL  Force an atomic create operation. This causes the call
                   to fail if the file already exists.

Argument 3 (INTEGER) specifies the permissions with which to create the file.
It may be ORed with the following:

        sys:DMDIR     Create a file as a directory.
        sys:DMEXCL    Create an exclusive-use directory.
        sys:DMAPPEND  Create an append-only directory.
