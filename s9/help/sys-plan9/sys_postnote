S9 EXT  (sys:postnote integer integer string)  ==>  boolean

Send a note to a process or process group. If the first argument is
PNPROC, then STRING is written to /proc/INTEGER (argument 2)/note. If
the first argument is PNGROUP, the note is delivered to the process group
by writing STRING to /proc/INTEGER (argument 2)/notepg.

For PNGROUP only, if the calling process is in the target group, the note
is not delivered to that process.

(sys:postnote sys:PNPROC 1234 "die")  ==>  #t
