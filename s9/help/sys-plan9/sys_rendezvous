S9 EXT  (sys:rendezvous string string)  ==>  string

Allows two processes to synchronize and exchange a value.

Two processes wishing to synchronize call rendezvous with a common
tag. One process will arrive at the rendezvous first; it suspends execution
until a second arrives. When a second process meets the rendezvous the value
arguments are exchanged between the processes and returned as the result
of the respective rendezvous system calls.

Both processes are awakened when the rendezvous succeeds.

(define tag #t)
(let ((pid (sys:rfork 20))) ; RFFDG|RFPROC = 20
    (if (eqv? pid 0)
        (format #t "I am the child and received: ~A~%"
            (sys:rendezvous 'tag "childish message"))
        (format #t "I am the parent and received: ~A~%"
            (sys:rendezvous 'tag "parental message"))))  ==>  I am the parent and received: childish message
                                                              I am the child and received: parental message
