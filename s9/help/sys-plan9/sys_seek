S9 EXT  (sys:seek integer integer integer)  ==>  integer

Sets the offset for the file associated with INTEGER (argument 1) as follows:

        If INTEGER (argument 3) is:

                0  The offset is set to INTEGER (argument 2) bytes.
                1  The pointer is set to its current location plus
                   INTEGER (argument 2).
                2  The pointer is set to the size of the file plus
                   INTEGER (argument 2).

        The new file offset value is returned.

        Seeking in a directory is not allowed. Seeking in a pipe is a no-op.
