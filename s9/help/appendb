S9 LIB  (append! list ...)         ==>  unspecific
        (append! list ... object)  ==>  unspecific

        (load-from-library "appendb.scm")

APPEND! is like APPEND, but appends the LISTs destructively.
It destroys all but the last object passed to it and returns
an unspecific value. The append!ed list will be stored in the
first LIST, which should be bound to a symbol or it will not
be accessible after the operation. The first LIST may not be
'().

(let ((a (list 1 2 3)))
  (append! a (list 4 5 6) 'end)
  a)                             ==>  (1 2 3 4 5 6 . end)
