;; The goal is to make the HTTP library cross-platform. At the moment importing
;; HTTP.SCM loads the curl extension in unix and the webfs in plan9.

;; HTTP:NEW-SESSION creates and returns a session object appropriate for the
;; platform: a curl-easy instance for unix, and a webfs instance for plan9.

;; HTTP:GET takes a url and returns the response as a string.

;; HTTP:POST takes a url and a payload and returns the response as a string.

;; HTTP:BASIC_AUTH enables http basic auth behavior on the session.

;; HTTP:USER:PASS sets the basic auth credentials on the session.

;; HTTP:GET-COOKIES returns all known cookies from give session.

;; HTTP:GET-COOKIE searches for a cookie that matches the passed REGEX and
;; returns it.

;; HTTP:SET-COOKIES sets cookies on the session according to the vector passed.
